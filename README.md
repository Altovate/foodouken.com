# foodouken.com

In light of the recent COVID-19 Pandemic, my team and I were looking for a way to support the local economy. Subsequently, we are creating a food delivery app to not only increase business for local food dispensaries but to also provide those of you living in Siem Reap with an easy and convenient means to connect with nearby vendors. The app – Foodouken – is a free food delivery app which was made in Siem Reap, for Siem Reap as a means to help local bussiness and our personal friends, the service will remain free for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If you would like to get involved, we are seeking programmers, experienced marketers, technical copywriters and UX designers (Figma). In donating your time and expertise, you will not only be welcomed into a collaborative and motivated team, but you will also be giving back to the town and people of Siem Reap. Please pm me with any questions or to let me know if you would like to participate in this project.

If you are a restraunt that would be interested in trialing this service, feel free to drop a comment below or pm me for more details.

Love,
Chris.
